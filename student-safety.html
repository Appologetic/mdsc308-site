            <h3>Because GSAs exist to promote a safe space for students belonging to a sexual minority, they run the risk of increasing occurrences of discrimination for club members. This means that <strong>student safety</strong>&nbsp;should be a top priority when creating a GSA.</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Here are some tips and tricks from research and evidence based successes to increase student safety when creating a GSA in your school environment:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Proper education and training for club facilitators (like the "safe adult")</span><br>Providing proper training to adults involved in the club on topics like appropriate leadership and crisis management will ensure that the safe adult is safe to be in a position of leadership for a vulnerable group, as well as ensure that they are able to step in and assist in an appropriate way if needed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Respect the privacy of students in and out of the club</span>By respecting the right to privacy of the students and not forcing them to join, or participate in discussion if they are uncomfortable doing so, the GSA can remain a safe space for students without presenting any safety concerns in or out of the classroom.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Create a clear code of conduct for all club members and "safe adults"</span><br>By creating a clear and enforceable&nbsp;code of conduct, and better yet involving the students in it's creation, a safe adult is able to set guidelines for discussion and action that all club members are comfortable with, enabling a safe space with clear consequences for when that safe space is violated.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Establishing safe and private meeting spaces</span><br>By establishing a space to meet that is public enough that students feel safe being there with an adult, and private enough that no prejudice from students outside the GSA can violate the safe space will enable student safety by limiting the ways that student safety can be violated.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Create an emergency plan of action for if/when cases of harassment or other safety concerns occur</span><br>In the worst case scenario, having an emergency plan of action for how to deal with instances of harassment, and ensuring that all members are aware of the plan, can ensure that students feel that they are protected and maintain the sanctity and longevity of the safe space even if harassment does occur.</p>
