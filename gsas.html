                            <p class="text-start mb-0">A Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) is a school-based initiative with a goal of providing students that belong to a sexual minority with a safe space that they can enjoy in which they can freely and safely express themselves and generate a sense of community (1). The number of these clubs in North America has increased in recent years (1), likely due to the many initiatives and resources available that now walk teachers, students, and administrative school staff through the process of setting up a GSA within their community (2).</p>

                            <p class="text-start mb-0">A key aspect of GSAs are that they are <strong>student-led initiatives </strong>which allows the students to guide discussion and create a safe space where they, and other students, feel welcome and free to express themselves, and provides student leadership opportunities in the decision of which matters are important to them (1). That said, the presence of a teacher in school based clubs is a requirement of most Alberta school boards, and is <strong>highly&nbsp;recommended</strong>&nbsp;by the literature in the formation of GSAs (3). This teacher is typically referred to the "safe adult" and it is their role to ensure that students of a sexual minority feel safe and free to express themselves about topics both club related, and related to their own lives.</p>

                            <p class="text-start mb-0">Studies show that the creation of a protected community like a GSA and the assigning of a "safe adult" that students of a sexual minority feel comfortable coming to are associated with a reduced risk of suicide, improved social and emotional health outcomes, and improved rates of academic success both in secondary schools and beyond (1, 4).</p>

                            <p class="text-start mb-0">In addition to having many individual benefits, GSAs have proven to be key aspects of creating a positive, inclusive and safe school culture in the schools that they are implemented in. Specifically, their presence has been associated with reduced occurrences of homophobia, reduced victimization, increased levels of teacher intervention, greater levels of school safety, less absences, and greater awareness that a safe adult exists within the school community who can help when needed (4).</p>

                            <p class="text-start mb-0">On <a href="https://gaystraightalliances.info/depression">our page</a> where we discuss depression and why it impacts students identifying as a sexual minority specifically, we highlighted increased victimization, reduced perceived school efficacy to intervene when needed, and reduced social support as key factors in the elevated prevalence of depression among this population. The introduction of a GSA to the school community tackles all 3 of these by creating awareness for teachers and students as well as a safe space for the population to reduce victimization within the schools, increasing collective school efficacy by provisioning a safe adult who is more likely to intervene when instances of homophobia or discrimination are present, and generating a safe space for sexual minority students to build a social support network. As a result, it's no surprise that in schools that saw greater engagement with GSA associations, depression symptoms were significantly reduced (5).</p>
