However, in cases of depression, there is an imbalance in the levels of these three key neurotransmitters, referred to as the&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">monoamine hypothesis,&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">which causes what you can think of as lousy cell phone reception between the two nerves that are trying to communicate (3-4). Because of this horrible reception, the cells cannot tell each other how to act due to the low levels of neurotransmitters. Specifically, low levels of norepinephrine have been associated with poor memory, lethargy, poor emotional regulation, poor mood, and an inability to concentrate (5). Serotonin and dopamine on the other hand, are commonly called the "feel good" neurotransmitters, and low levels of them have been found to impair&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">signal transduction</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">, the ability of the cell to respond to other neurotransmitters and chemicals in the environment (5). Due to these associated symptoms, the monoamine hypothesis recognizes an imbalance in these neurotransmitters as a probable cause for the symptoms of depression.</span></p>

                        <p class="text-start mb-0"><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">Studies have determined a number of social and societal factors that put students and sexual minorities at greater risk for depression. For students, these include the perceived collective school efficacy, or the trust that an individual has that the school will support them when they are struggling, and the ability to seek support from social systems like friends and family (8). Additionally, victimization, such as traditional forms of bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, the threat of harm, etc., was found to have a damaging effect on these factors, putting students at additional risk for depression (8).</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">For sexual minorities, victimization through harassment and abuse was also found to be associated with the increased prevalence of depression in this community, in addition to reduced family/social support and increased levels of stress (9). Stress as a contributor to depression is critical as members of this community experience what is known as&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">minority stress&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">(10)</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">Since sexual minorities are stigmatized in our society, they experience more stress than heterosexual individuals based on the expectation of rejection, increased danger of victimization, and, most significantly, the feeling that the world is homophobic (10). The minority stress model tells us that stress processes related to these perceptions can lead to adverse mental health outcomes and has specifically been shown to increase depression among sexual minorities (10).</span></p>

However, the threat they experience is more than just the sum of both groups. Instead, a level of interaction exists between being a member of these two groups that makes the experience of being a student belonging to a sexual minority different from just being a student or just being a member of a sexual minority. This perspective is called&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">intersectionality&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background-color: transparent;">and is demonstrated wonderfully by the factors contributing to depression for sexual minorities and students. Notice that the lack of social support systems appears as a risk factor for both groups and that victimization, which also appears for both groups, further impairs this (11-13). In this way, the societal factors which put this population at greater risk interact with one another to put them at even greater risk and are visually represented in the diagram below.</span></p><img src="assets/img/Team%20document.png" style="width: 103%;">

In the case of sexual minority students, depression impacts this marginalized population to a much greater extent than heterosexual students, as discussed previously, where their gender, sexual orientation and studentship expose them to the mechanism described in the sections above and act as a social determinant of health. As such, depression among this population is a health inequity. Luckily, this means that interventions targeting this population and the societal risk factors that expose them to depression can lessen the burden and positively impact students of a sexual minority.</span></p>
