                        <p class="text-start mb-0">The central nervous system in our bodies uses several key neurotransmitters to function including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. <strong>Neurotransmitters </strong>such as these are chemical messengers that the cells of our nervous system (our nerves) use to communicate with one another, and the messages that they help to relay are believed to contribute to the regulation of our mood. However, in cases of depression, there is an imbalance in the levels of these three key neurotransmitters. In science, this is referred to this as the <strong>monoamine hypothesis</strong>&nbsp;which causes what you can think of as bad cell phone reception between the two nerves that are trying to communicate. Because of this bad reception, the cells are not able to tell each other how to act due to the low levels of neurotransmitters present. Specifically low levels of norepinephrine has been associated with poor memory, lethargy, poor emotional regulation, poor mood, and an inability to concentrate. Serotonin and dopamine on the other hand are commonly called the "feel good" neurotransmitters, and low levels of them have been found to impair <strong>signal transduction</strong>, the ability for the cell to respond to other neurotransmitters and chemicals in the environment. Due to these associated symptoms, the monoamine hypothesis recognizes an imbalance in these neurotransmitters as a probable cause for the symptoms of depression.</p>

Not only is the prevalence of depression among students high, but it's also climbing, and has increased 13% in the last 10 years.<br><br>When it comes to students that identify as a sexual minority, the risk is <strong>even bigger</strong>. Not only are they almost <strong>2x as likely as heterosexual students to cope with moderate to severe depression</strong>, but they are also <strong>3x more likely to be hospitalized and treated for injuries sustained during an attempted suicide</strong>. Taken together, these statistics are striking and indicate an immediate need for an intervention which helps these students specifically to reduce the prevalence and burden of depression among this population, and in doing so, hopefully save the lives of sexual minority students.</p>

                        <p class="text-start mb-0">Studies have determined a number of social and societal factors which put both students and sexual minorities at greater risk for depression. For students, these include the perceived collective school efficacy, or the trust that an individual has that the school will support them when they are struggling, and the ability for the individual to seek support from social systems like friends and family. Additionally, victimization such as traditional forms of bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, threat of harm, etc. was found to have a damaging effect on these factors, putting students at further risk for depression.<br><br>For sexual minorities, victimization through harassment and abuse were also found to be associated with the increased prevalence of depression in this community, in addition to reduced family/social support and increased levels of stress. Stress as a contributor to depression is of special importance as members of this community experience what is known of <strong>minority stress. </strong>Since sexual minorities are stigmatized in our society, they experience more stress than heterosexual individuals based on the expectation of rejection, increased danger of victimization, and, most significantly, the feeling that the world is homophobic. The minority stress model tells us that stress processes related to these perceptions can lead to adverse mental health incomes, and has specifically been shown to increase depression among sexual minorities.</p>

                        <p class="text-start mb-0">It's important to note that students of a sexual minority belong to both these groups which have been demonstrated separately to be specifically at risk, which puts them at even greater risk of experiencing depression. However, the risk that they experience is more than just the sum of both groups. Instead there is a level of interaction that exists between being a member of these two groups that makes the experience of being a student belonging to a sexual minority different from just being a student or just being a member of a sexual minority. This perspective is called&nbsp;<strong>intersectionality&nbsp;</strong>and is demonstrated wonderfully by the factors which contribute to depression for sexual minorities and students. Notice that the lack of social support systems appear as a risk factor for both groups, and that victimization also appears for both groups further impairs this. In this way, the societal factors which put this population at greater risk interact with one another to put them at even greater risk and is visually represented in the diagram below.</p>
